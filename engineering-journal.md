### Entry 3
**Date**: 2025-07-30 11:12  
**Component**: Core Foundation Modules  
**Attempted**: Implement configuration system, database models, logging, and exception handling  
**Issue**: None  
**Solution**: Successfully created comprehensive foundation with multi-source config support, encrypted credential storage, structured logging, and proper error handling  
**Result**: Solid foundation ready for CalDAV and Google Calendar integration
