# Engineering Journal - CalDAV Sync Microservice

## Purpose
This journal tracks the development progress, decisions, challenges, and solutions encountered while building the CalDAV Sync Microservice. It serves as an append-only log for future engineers or AI instances to understand the development journey.

## Development Log

### Entry 1
**Date**: 2025-07-30 11:08  
**Component**: Project Initialization  
**Attempted**: Set up Git repository, configuration, and project structure  
**Issue**: None  
**Solution**: Successfully initialized Git repo with proper .gitignore for Python/Docker project  
**Result**: Clean foundation ready for development  
**Notes**: Using conventional commit messages and frequent commits as requested. Git configured with local developer identity.

### Entry 3
**Date**: 2025-07-30 11:12  
**Component**: Core Foundation Modules  
**Attempted**: Implement configuration system, database models, logging, and exception handling  
**Issue**: None  
**Solution**: Successfully created comprehensive foundation with multi-source config support, encrypted credential storage, structured logging, and proper error handling  
**Result**: Solid foundation ready for CalDAV and Google Calendar integration  
**Notes**: Configuration supports ENV vars → YAML → defaults precedence. Database models include all required entities with proper relationships and indexes. Logging system provides specialized loggers for different components. Custom exceptions enable proper error handling throughout the application.

### Entry 4
**Date**: 2025-07-30 11:17  
**Component**: CalDAV and Google Calendar Integration  
**Attempted**: Implement complete CalDAV and Google Calendar client modules with authentication  
**Issue**: None  
**Solution**: Successfully created comprehensive integration modules with proper error handling, rate limiting, and event normalization  
**Result**: Full CalDAV and Google Calendar integration ready for sync engine  
**Notes**: CalDAV client supports connection testing, calendar discovery, and event CRUD operations. Google OAuth manager handles token lifecycle with automatic refresh. Google Calendar client includes rate limiting and batch operations. Both modules support recurring events and timezone handling.

### Entry 5
**Date**: 2025-07-30 11:22  
**Component**: Complete Sync Engine Implementation  
**Attempted**: Build the complete sync engine with bidirectional support, conflict resolution, and webhook delivery  
**Issue**: None  
**Solution**: Successfully implemented all sync engine components including event normalization, diffing, conflict resolution, webhook delivery, and APScheduler-based background jobs  
**Result**: Complete sync engine ready for API and UI integration  
**Notes**: Sync engine supports all three directions (CalDAV→Google, Google→CalDAV, bidirectional) with proper conflict resolution using timestamp comparison and CalDAV fallback. Webhook system includes retry logic and non-blocking operation. Scheduler prevents job overlaps and provides per-mapping isolation. All components include comprehensive error handling and logging.

### Entry 6
**Date**: 2025-07-30 11:40  
**Component**: Complete FastAPI Application with API Endpoints  
**Attempted**: Implement comprehensive REST API with all endpoints specified in README  
**Issue**: None  
**Solution**: Successfully created complete FastAPI application with all required API endpoints, security, validation, and error handling  
**Result**: Fully functional REST API ready for deployment and web UI integration  
**Notes**: API includes CalDAV account management, Google OAuth flow, calendar mapping CRUD, sync operations, and comprehensive status monitoring. Security implements localhost exception with API key authentication for external requests. All endpoints include proper validation, error handling, and rate limiting. Application supports CORS, security headers, and structured error responses.
